# News Category Classification

This repository contains the implementation and training of various machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), aimed at classifying news articles into predefined categories. The models are trained on a comprehensive dataset obtained from Kaggle's News Category Dataset.

## Data Preparation
The dataset comprises numerous news articles, each labeled with a corresponding category. The initial phase of the project involves a thorough data cleaning and preprocessing routine to ensure the quality and consistency of the input data. Following this, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the distribution of categories, the frequency of words, and other patterns that may influence the categorization process.

## Model Training
Each model—CNN, LSTM, and BERT—is meticulously trained and validated to achieve optimal performance. The training process is documented, and the performance metrics are recorded to compare the efficacy of each model type in accurately predicting the news categories.

## Final Degree Project Integration
This work is part of my final degree project for Computer Engineering. The trained models are integrated into a news aggregation mobile application, serving as the backbone for the article categorization feature. The application utilizes the predictive power of the models to automatically tag incoming news articles with the appropriate category, enhancing the user experience by providing organized and easily navigable content.

Feel free to explore the models and contribute to the project!
